The purpose of this project is to build a simple large language model from scratch.


This repo is following the guide from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU1WVnMk4E8

In this repo:
- ./shakespeare.txt - This is a sample text used for training a smaller scale model
- ./bigram_testing.sync.ipynb - This notebook is where I test a basic BiGram model


### Prepare environment
`pip install -r ./requirements-base.txt`
`pip install -r ./requirements-pytorch.txt`
